            <p id="blurb"><span class="illuminated">S</span>hort fiction and especially the short story format has always held an attraction for me. Some of my favorite reading as a kid was pulp SF magazines and the annual collections of the best short stories. I also loved mysteries, especially Sherlock Holmes. In a short story, the author must establish the setting, introduce the characters, tell the story, and reach a satisfying conclusion, all in a few hundred words. I have tried my hand at the form, in widely varied genres and styles. The stories are available in three collections. Some of the stories are available to <a href="./samples.html">read online</a>.</p>
