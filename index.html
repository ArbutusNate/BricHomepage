                    <p class="card-text">On the evening of Thursday, November 4, 1875, the steamship Pacific collided with the clipper ship Orpheus off Cape Flattery in Washington.  The Orpheus resumed her journey but the Pacific – old, unsafe, and dangerously overcrowded – broke up in minutes and went down, scattering hundreds of men, women, and children into the sea.  Exactly how many died will never be known, but the names we know are enough to make this still the worst maritime disaster in the history of the West Coast.</p>

With a diverse group of characters, I set out in a 1947 Cadillac ambulance on a search for the fields where peyote grows.</p>

                      <p class="card-text">After nearly two years on a schooner in North Atlantic gales, I was looking for warmer water.  I flew to the Kingdom of Tonga, where my brother was training Peace Corps volunteers.  Although I loved the people and country of Tonga, my tourist visa expired and I had to leave.  With no money, my options were few.  Then I found a yacht that would take me on as navigator – Warana, the Australian nuclear protest vessel, bound for Mururoa atoll in French Polynesia, to anchor at ground zero to prevent the French from testing more nuclear weapons there.</p>

                      <p class="card-text">February 1969 – Just as Californians roll with all the minor earthquakes, by 1969 I had been arrested four times but never served hard time.  But just as Californians dread The Big One, I was worried about The Big One bust, the one that would ruin my life. A group of us decided to attend a big underground film festival in Dallas, and eight of us dropped acid and piled into my bus.  After the event, the police pulled me over and searched the car.  Even though we’d been extremely careful not to have any illicit substances with us, they planted some roaches on us and hauled us all off to jail.  Under Texas law, since I already had an arrest record, the sentence for possession of marijuana was a mandatory life sentence with no chance of parole.  My attorney told me, “If you walk into the courtroom, you’ll never walk out.”  This was indeed The Big One.</p>
