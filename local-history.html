              <p>A fictionalized account of the arrival in Marin County of the Short-Meriner family in 1846.  The family became prominent Marin pioneers and once owned much of San Rafael and San Anselmo (including my own home).  Jane Meriner, a 37-year-old widow, her two teenage sons by her first marriage, J. O. B. and Jacob Short, and her small daughters by her second husband, Elizabeth and Catherine Meriner, drove their covered wagon along the California Trail from Missouri to San Rafael.  They were friends of the Donner party and traveled part of the way with them, crossing Roller Pass instead of Donner Pass and getting across just before the storm that doomed the Donners.  Since there are many accounts of the California Trail, this account describes only the final part of their journey, from the end of the Trail at Johnson’s Rancho in Yolo County and across the Central Valley to the San Rafael Mission, where they lived in the abandoned buildings.  60 pages, with maps and illustrations.</p>

              <p>On the evening of Thursday, November 4, 1875, the steamship Pacific collided with the clipper ship Orpheus off Cape Flattery in Washington.  The Orpheus resumed her journey but the Pacific – old, unsafe, and dangerously overcrowded – broke up in minutes and went down, scattering hundreds of men, women, and children into the sea.  Exactly how many died will never be known, but the names we know are enough to make this still the worst maritime disaster in the history of the West Coast.  Only two men survived, and their first-hand accounts are here.  The passengers included many wealthy and famous people, along with gold miners, singers, actors, and an equestrian troupe.  One passenger had already survived three other shipwrecks on the same passage.  Several were carrying large amounts of gold.  The stories of how they came to be aboard that night are as interesting as the disaster itself.  In period newspaper articles, letters, diaries, and mysterious notes in bottles, the tales are told.</p>
              <p>The Captains – Jefferson Davis Howell (brother-in-law of President Jefferson Davis) of the Pacific, and Charles Sawyer of the Orpheus – were both young but very experienced.  Who was at fault?  Were they drunk?  Could the collision have been averted, or more lives saved?  Were the ships safe?  Were the officers and crews and owners competent?  Was there an official cover-up?  Was the “last will in a bottle” genuine?  We will examine the evidence.</p>
              <p>73 pages, illustrated with photographs and drawings of the ships and participants, this volume examines all aspects of a singular disaster.  The poignancy of the deaths, and the devastation felt by so many left behind, made a mark on a generation that they remembered the rest of their lives.  In the impact it had on people’s lives and imaginations, the sinking of the Pacific was the Titanic of its era.</p>

              <p>In 1911, the Marin Journal, forerunner of the Marin Independent Journal, published a special Golden Anniversary edition commemorating its first fifty years of publication.  Sixteen pages long and printed on book-quality paper, the edition consisted entirely of a series of illustrated articles about each community in Marin County, each written by a local correspondent, extolling the virtues of their towns.  These give an intriguing view of how local residents viewed their communities, their progress, and their hopes for the future, more than a century ago.  The pride and their hopes glow through their words.</p>
              <p>The special edition was followed by a series of weekly articles detailing the history of Marin County.  While there are inaccuracies, these articles were written when many of the founding pioneers of the county were still alive, and contain much information not available elsewhere.  While there are many histories of California, this series focuses on Marin County alone and describes the people and events that made the county and formed its culture.</p>
              <p>Taken together, the special edition and the history articles give an intimate look at the county as seen by its founders and residents more than a century ago.  79 pages, with original illustrations from the newspaper.</p>

            <p>In 1916, at age 94, Charles August Lauff (1822- 1917) narrated the reminiscences that follow in a series of articles for the San Rafael Independent.  The picture he paints of Marin County provides us with a glimpse of the County’s early topography and settlers, bringing to life the rancho era and the personalities of such original land grantees as Timothy Murphy, John Reed and William Richardson.  In addition, he recounts his experiences during the Gold Rush and provides details about life in San Francisco, Sacramento and other burgeoning towns in Northern California.  73 pages, with a portrait of Lauff, a map of the Mexican land grants in Marin County, and extensively annotated.</p>

          <p id="blurb"><span class="illuminated">S</span>ince moving to Marin County in 1986, I have been drawn to learning more about the fascinating history of this beautiful area.  Working with local historians, libraries, online digital newspapers and genealogies, I have compiled several books about items of local history.  Several are edited collections of newspaper series about the early days of Marin County, making readily available resources that, while available online, were barely readable and spread across many files.  Others are just things I became curious about and decided to research and document, or odd things I came across in the old newspapers.</p>
