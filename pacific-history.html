        I have always been fascinated with the South Pacific – the original culture so distinctively different from any other, the attractive, romantic islands and their people; and the hair-raising adventures of the first European contacts.  While pursuing my research for other writing projects, I have encountered many rare and all-but-forgotten books lying sequestered on the shelves of closed stacks in a few libraries specializing in Pacificana.  Sitting in those stacks, reading original books more than two centuries old, I found wonderful stories and adventures.  Many captains - and a few sailors - wrote books about their travels.  Stories of castaways or enslaved Christians were immensely popular, as were travelogues of exotic lands.  But the books are dusty and unread.  They are all long out of print, some for centuries, and a researcher or collector must pay handsomely to acquire one.
        A handful of these books are now available as quality affordable paperbacks.  Every word and image from the original book is included.  But I have added explanatory notes and extensive additional material in bottom-of-the-page footnotes.  So if you want to read a good yarn, skip the notes and maintain the author’s narrative flow.  But if you are curious about the people, places, or events mentioned, a glance at the bottom of the page gives a more in-depth understanding without having to mark your place and search through appendices.
