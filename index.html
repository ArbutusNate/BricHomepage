Built in 1878 and originally going to San Rafael, not Fairfax, it was an important connection with the remote coast.  Meet the men who planned it, the surveyor who designed it, and the contractors who built it.  Learn of its many routes over the years.  A racist militia attack against the Chinese laborers was narrowly averted.  A stagecoach line operated on it for 37 years, run by a string of colorful characters.  Mud, landslides, wild animals, earthquakes, runaways, fires, overturns, and a holdup reveal the fascinating history of this famous road.  191 pages, extensively annotated, with 70 pictures, 25 maps, and an index.</p><a target="_blank" href="local-history.html">See more...<a/>

While in some cases inaccurate by current knowledge, these articles reveal interesting history, fascinating pioneer characters, and the way Marin residents viewed their county over 100 years ago.  203 pages and extensively annotated.</p>

                      <p class="card-text">January to May 1968 – I dropped out of Antioch College in Ohio, becoming prime bait for the draft, and hit the road for California.  I hitchhiked to Boulder, Colorado, where I first encountered the psychedelic cactus peyote.  With a diverse group of characters, I set out in a 1947 Cadillac ambulance on a search for the fields where peyote grows.  After many adventures with Navajos, vigilantes, and rednecks, we find the fields, but are soon busted by the Border Patrol and spend a week in jail in Rio Grande City.  I have interesting conversations with some local high-school hippies.  When I get out of jail, I hitchhike to Fort Worth and fall in with a hippie commune.  My 21st birthday party is busted by the cops and I go to jail for vagrancy and loitering.  After more adventures, I finally get back on the road for California.  Paperback, 163 pages, illustrated. </p>

                      <p class="card-text">July 1973 to January 1974 – I set out to see the world and have adventures.  After nearly two years on a schooner in North Atlantic gales, I was looking for warmer water.  I flew to the Kingdom of Tonga, where my brother was training Peace Corps volunteers.  Although I loved the people and country of Tonga, my tourist visa expired and I had to leave.  With no money, my options were few.  Then I found a yacht that would take me on as navigator – Warana, the Australian nuclear protest vessel, bound for Mururoa atoll in French Polynesia, to anchor at ground zero to prevent the French from testing more nuclear weapons there.  I joined a disillusioned and discontented crew of misfits, all of whom soon gave up and returned home.  With the skipper Peter Sturgess and a crew of American hippies rounded up from waterfront bars, I began the voyage to Australia, visiting Fiji, New Hebrides (now Vanuatu), New Caledonia, Brisbane, Sydney, and Melbourne.  There I helped refit the boat for racing and set out on the grueling 650-mile Sydney-Hobart open ocean race.  Paperback, 200 pages, illustrated.</p>
